# Redux Toolkit

The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

- "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
- "Have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
- "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

Now Redux toolkit with React try to provide some tools that abstract over the setup process and handle the most common use cases, as well as include some useful utilities that will let the user simplify their application code.

Redux Toolkit also includes a powerful data fetching and caching capability named "RTK Query". It's included in the package as a separate set of entry points. It's optional, but can eliminate the need to hand-write data fetching logic yourself.
